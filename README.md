# C_Sharp-Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

## Projects

- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/abl73-public/C_Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

- [Code First Student Db](https://github.com/abl73-public/C_Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CodeFirstStudentDb)

### Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website.  
It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic.  
There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Code First Student Db

This project is a console application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First workflow.  
It stores in a database students info and grades for a school.  
It is still a work in progress.
